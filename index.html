Budget (All prices in USD)
<br>
How much did I spend in Japan broken down here:
    <br>
Airfare: $800 -- $600 LAX <RT> KIX * DFW <RT> LAX $200
<br>
Airchina (LAX to HND for the price it was a good flight, but the people in front of me would constantly lean back and the 31 inch leg room was nothing after that. <br>Food on the plane was basic: chicken/beef and rice with some sides like fruit and a cookie.)
Delta and American Airline (DFW to LAX was great both flights were comfortable and very new airliners. Updated games on the screen made for a quick flight.)
    <br>
Flying with a budget airline wasn't bad, but I would do direct from now on because going through China was a hassle on my trip.
<br>
Accomadation: $315 -- Sharing cheap 3✪ hotels with 2 friends brought this down. Airbnb is another option although Japan has cracked down a bit on it so be careful where you choose (always within a short walk to a train station!)
<br>
Food: $270 -- $30 a day is a great amount for breakfast, lunch and dinner with some room to spare for other stuff you may find interesting. You may spend a lot less if you eat out only half the time, but where's the fun in that?
<br>
Entertainment: $50 -- random stuff like shrines and temples that require entrance fees.
<br>
Random spending: $100 -- gifts for yourself, souvenirs for your friends and family. Remember to get them something too!
<br>
Transportation: $120 -- to get around everywhere you may not need a JR pass, we didn't, but look into one if you need it. 
<br>

Arrival // Day 1<br>
<br>
<br>

<br>
After our long flights over the Pacific Ocean and a brief stop at Beijing we received a free shuttle to karaksa Spring<br>
hotel. We woke up early in the morning for the very enjoyable western and japanese breakfast, and got ready for the<br>
ferry to Kobe.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Kobe // Day 2<br>
<br>
<br>
<div class="container-kobe">

<br>
The quickest and a unique way instead of the train was to take the 500 yen ferry from Kansai airport to Kobe airport. <br>
From there we had to take the Portliner then a short walk to Hanshin line for our hotel at Sunroute Sopra Kobe Annesso. After <br>
40 minutes on the train we wandered the area.<br>
<br>
Kyoto // Days 3-7<br>
<br>
<br>
We spent a lot of time in Kyoto and one of the coolest experiences was the Jidai Matsuri festival. When we first got to<br>
Kyoto though we settled in at the nearby area and our hotel Seibido Inn. Renting bikes and taking quick ganders around Kyoto<br>
Imperial Palace, as well as checking out arcades was the start of a few days for us.<br>

<br>
Obviously there was a lot of good food to be had we tried a lot of places like: Yakiniku Hiro, Tenkaippin Ramen,<br>
and Avocado (Mexican restaraunt in japan). Trying out convenience store food or food stalls was usually how we kicked off <br>
breakfast. Places like Lawson's, Food Mart, and 7-Eleven were all great and had a lot more healthy food.<br>

// If you're looking for milk like we were it was 牛乳 (Gyūnyū) and not ミルク (miruku) the difference was that miruku was <br>
generally a milk-based drink and not really milk. //<br>
