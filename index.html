Budget (All prices in USD)
<br>
How much did I spend in Japan broken down here:
    <br>
Airfare: $800 -- $600 LAX <RT> KIX * DFW <RT> LAX $200
<br>
Airchina (LAX to HND for the price it was a good flight, but the people in front of me would constantly lean back and the 31 inch leg room was nothing after that. <br>Food on the plane was basic: chicken/beef and rice with some sides like fruit and a cookie.)
Delta and American Airline (DFW to LAX was great both flights were comfortable and very new airliners. Updated games on the screen made for a quick flight.)
    <br>
Flying with a budget airline wasn't bad, but I would do direct from now on because going through China was a hassle on my trip.
<br>
Accomadation: $315 -- Sharing cheap 3âœª hotels with 2 friends brought this down. Airbnb is another option although Japan has cracked down a bit on it so be careful where you choose (always within a short walk to a train station!)
<br>
Food: $270 -- $30 a day is a great amount for breakfast, lunch and dinner with some room to spare for other stuff you may find interesting. You may spend a lot less if you eat out only half the time, but where's the fun in that?
<br>
Entertainment: $50 -- random stuff like shrines and temples that require entrance fees.
<br>
Random spending: $100 -- gifts for yourself, souvenirs for your friends and family. Remember to get them something too!
<br>
Transportation: $120 -- to get around everywhere you may not need a JR pass, we didn't, but look into one if you need it.
